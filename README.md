Python Project for Data Science - Analysing Historical Stock/Revenue Data

For anyone reading this, I wasn't able to create a new Cloud Object Storage instance to attach to a project per the instructions. 
I also attempted to export my Jupyter notebook to PDF and HTML and both file formats removed the charts at the end of the assignment. I hope the attached screenshots will suffice.
Sorry for any inconvenience.
